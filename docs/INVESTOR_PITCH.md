# TrackVerse Investor Pitch Script

## 🎯 The 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "TrackVerse is **Strava meets Instagram for high school track & field**. We're building the platform where 600,000+ high school track athletes track their times, compete on leaderboards, get discovered by college scouts, and connect with their community. Think of us as the **vertical social network for the next generation of Olympic athletes**."

## 📊 The Problem (30 seconds)

**"Let me tell you about a $3 billion blind spot in youth sports."**

- **600,000+ high school track athletes** in the US alone have no dedicated platform
- Athletes track PRs in **spreadsheets and notes apps**
- Coaches manage rosters via **group texts and paper sign-ups**
- College scouts spend **hundreds of hours** manually searching for talent
- Parents have **no visibility** into their athlete's progress

**The current solution?** Fragmented tools that don't talk to each other. MileSplit for results. Strava for runs. Instagram for highlights. Nothing connects the ecosystem.

## 🎤 Closing Statement

> "Every Olympic sprinter started as a high school kid dreaming of going fast. TrackVerse is where that journey begins. We're not just building an app - we're building the platform that will discover the next Usain Bolt."

## ❓ Anticipated Q&A

**Q: How do you acquire users?**
A: Coach-led viral loops. One coach signs up, invites 40 athletes. We target track coaches through state associations and coaching conferences.

**Q: What about MileSplit?**
A: MileSplit is a results database. We're a social platform. They're the record book; we're the daily experience.

**Q: How do you verify times?**
A: Coach verification, meet result imports, and community flagging. Fraudulent times get caught quickly in a competitive community.

**Q: Why mobile-first?**
A: Athletes are on their phones at the track. They want to log a PR immediately, not wait until they get home.

**Q: What's your CAC?**
A: Near-zero for athletes (viral). ~$50 for coaches (targeted ads + conferences). Scouts find us organically.

**Q: How defensible is this?**
A: Network effects + data moat. Once a team is on TrackVerse, switching costs are high. Our ranking algorithm improves with more data.
